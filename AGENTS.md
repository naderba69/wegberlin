# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

Sync batch: v161 · 2026-09-23 · re-verified in full against pack `dwnb-full-pack-v161`.

# Der Weg nach Berlin product rules

Read `PROFESSIONAL_CONTINUATION_PROMPT_AR.md`, `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `P0_AUDIT.md`, `P1_AUDIT.md`, `P2_AUDIT.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` before changing product behavior.
The primary UX is Coach/Today, not a lesson catalog. Durable learner data is local-first.
Never claim incomplete curriculum or media is complete. Run `npm run check` before reporting success.
After every batch, re-sync every standing document listed in `docs/adr/ADR-079-documentation-sync-marker.md` and update its `Sync batch: vNNN` marker; `npm run handoff:check` fails while a document lags the current pack generation.
The optional WebGPU model is Opt-in: never commit its downloaded weights, loosen pinned runtime/model hashes, add a silent WASM/paid fallback, or claim CI mocks equal physical GPU installation.
