# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

Sync batch: v183 · 2026-10-07 · Repository-only invariant: `npm run review:signatures` scans the 22 committed generated review artifacts (5 lexical-packet CSVs + 17 review sheets = 4,935 rows, 21,406 reviewer-input cells) and reports `0` filled cells, so no generated file carries a name, decision, date, or note. `handoff:check` runs it, validates the file/row/cell denominators, and fails hard if any generated artifact ever gains reviewer input — the reviewer's signed copy must stay outside the generated set and the owner's decision is recorded in the approved record. The scan authenticates nobody, opens no evidence, and asserts no closure. Local `npm run check` passed: 1,386/1,386 tests in 204 files, lint/typecheck/audits clean, 323 statically built HTML pages; build fingerprint `3cf5c6d6be67` (full 6,007,392 gzip), JS 128 / 2,017,616 gzip / max 262,117, media 544 / 52,943,843 bytes, curriculum 1,118,105 gzip, contrast 323 pages / 22,960 elements / 0 failures; regenerated tracked `public/offline-size-manifest.json`, `reports/js-budget-report.json`, `reports/media-pack-budget-report.json`, `reports/human-review-audit.json`, `docs/generated/HUMAN_REVIEW_LEDGER.md`, and `reports/lexical-review-packet/README.md`. No cache generation change (v183 active/staging; v182 rollback). Quality Gate `37664737685` passed on `3e2fb07`: `check` 6m12s and E2E 21m17s. The Vercel preview for this revision hit the external project quota again (`upgradeToPro=build-rate-limit`); the previously recorded successful preview on `d121da0` still stands as the last built one. No Production claim and no merge claim; PR #7 remains open.

Historical v182 follow-up: `neutral-self-waveform-comparison-v1` processes same-origin model audio and the learner Blob in memory only (≤60 seconds / ≤4,000,000 compressed bytes each); active/staging were v182 with v181 retained then. Current active/staging caches are v183, with v182 retained for rollback. Route list and learner-state schema are unchanged; P2-355's authored mini-test generator remains available in every Offline pack.

P2-355 remains intact: `/practice/test-generator` and its 480 authored templates from 96 published lessons are included in all five Offline packs; feedback is session-only with no mastery, progress, CEFR, or daily-plan effect.

Pushed P2-352 head `b974c48` passed Quality Gate `37335158220` (64/64 Desktop + 64/64 Mobile E2E) and Vercel Preview; P0-302 is closed. PR #7 remains open, so P0-301 is partial until it is closed. Deployment Smoke was skipped by its guard; no production deployment is claimed.

Current contract: ADR-100 (2026-10-02) supersedes earlier completion/readiness/time guarantees. Read docs/LEARNING_REPAIRS_AR.md and the current QA block in PROJECT_STATUS.md; historical measurements below are not current source evidence.

Independent evidence policy v2: bootstrap exits after real progress; never trust legacy readiness caches as new independent proof, never raise whole-lesson mastery from self-graded cards, never merge productive volume into a language score. Run fresh lesson:quality:audit and learning:integrity:audit as well as npm run check.

# Der Weg nach Berlin product rules

Read `PROFESSIONAL_CONTINUATION_PROMPT_AR.md`, `docs/MASTER_SPEC.md`, `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, `P0_AUDIT.md`, `P1_AUDIT.md`, `P2_AUDIT.md`, and `DECISIONS.md` before changing product behavior.
The primary UX is Coach/Today, not a lesson catalog. Durable learner data is local-first.
Never claim incomplete curriculum or media is complete. Run `npm run check` before reporting success.
After every batch, re-sync every standing document listed in `docs/adr/ADR-079-documentation-sync-marker.md` and update its `Sync batch: vNNN` marker; `npm run handoff:check` fails while a document lags the current pack generation.
The optional WebGPU model is Opt-in: never commit its downloaded weights, loosen pinned runtime/model hashes, add a silent WASM/paid fallback, or claim CI mocks equal physical GPU installation.
