## Cross-reference gates

- published lesson metadata → academic lesson object;
- diagnostic listening item → real listening-library item;
- exam task/profile/dashboard → known official source IDs;
- matching item → option ID;
- listening item → clip ID;
- choice/listening correct index → available option;
- full dashboard → published provider-owned task ID;
- unique IDs within every root collection.

The committed report is checked during `prebuild`; content drift without regenerated reports fails the build.
